# GtirbSharp
[![NuGet Package](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/LibPacketGremlin.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibPacketGremlin/)

.NET library for the [GTIRB](https://github.com/GrammaTech/gtirb) format.

Code, documentation, and tests were ported directly from the official repo where possible.

Core functionality has been implemented, while some "nice to have" APIs that can be implemented using the core functionality remain a TODO. This will remain a pre-release until the library gets used in a real application, but please file issues if any bugs are found.
